C++ console application
IDE used Qt 5.6
Application purpose - count the number of unique words from console input

Program reads the input data from the console,
then converts string to the lower case
(because word "HELLO" is equal to word "hello" but they are in different cases)
next check if string characters are in range from 'a' to 'z' 
if not they will be ignored
(for example word "he4llo" became "hello", word "1234" will be ignored) 
and in the end program displays console the number of unique words and which they are.
